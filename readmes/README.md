## My process

### Build with

- Sem√¢ntic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- Display flex

- Responsive site

O que aprendi:


With each project I get better at the positioning of each div and how to transform texts and shapes, as well as borders.

In this project I learned how to shade text and import an external source


### Continuous development


I'm still very limited in what I can do, but it's a matter of practice, improving in everything I can.
